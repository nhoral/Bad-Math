# Bad Math - Neural Network Division

This project demonstrates a neural network learning to perform division. While computers can already perform division perfectly using standard arithmetic, this project serves as an educational example of how neural networks can learn mathematical operations.

## Overview

The neural network takes two inputs (numerator and denominator) and attempts to predict their quotient. The model is trained continuously until interrupted, and can be evaluated on both random test cases and specific division problems.

# Running

python train.py [--reset]
python evaluate.py [numerator] [denominator]
